# you should have read in the outcome data and have the formatted exposure data for all targets.

# I manually read in the .csv file I had saved of the formatted exposure data but you may use the existing file in your R environment.
For this code, I will continue to use LTA as an example.

# read in exposure data file and clump SNVs.

LTA <- read_exposure_data(
  "LTA.csv",
  clump = TRUE,
  sep = ",",
  snp_col = "SNP",
  beta_col = "BETA",
  se_col = "SE",
  eaf_col = "A1FREQ",
  effect_allele_col = "ALLELE1",
  other_allele_col = "ALLELE0",
  pval_col = "transformedp",
  min_pval = 1e-200,
  log_pval = FALSE,
  chr_col = "chrom",
)

# harmonize clumped exposure data with outcome data and perform MR.

dat <- harmonise_data(LTA, kunkle) 
mr_results <- mr(dat)
mr_results

# repeat steps for each target for individual MR analyses.
